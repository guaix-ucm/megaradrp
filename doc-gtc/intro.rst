This guide is intended as an introductory overview of MEGARA Reduction Pipeline 
packages and explains how to install and make use of its most 
important features. In particular, this guide describes the pipeline 
integrated in the GTC control system (MEGARA Data Factory Pipeline or 
MEGARA DFP).

For detailed reference documentation of the functions and
classes contained in the package, see the :ref:`reference`.
    
.. note::

   Although the scope of the MEGARA Pipeline is the full set of observing
   modes of MEGARA, this release has a limited coverage of the modes. In
   particular only "Bias", "Dark", "Fiber-flat" and "Trace"
    
    
.. warning::

   This "User Guide" is still a work in progress; some of the material
   is not organized, and several aspects of the MEGARA Pipeline are not 
   yet covered in sufficient detail.
